Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"1099520":{"findings":[{"version":"1.20.2","paths":["express>body-parser"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<1.20.3","module_name":"body-parser","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7","cves":["CVE-2024-45590"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=1.20.3","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2024-09-10T19:01:11.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.20.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-405"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1099520,"references":"- https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7\n- https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/commit/b2695c4450f06ba3b0ccf48d872a229bb41c9bce\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45590\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7","created":"2024-09-10T15:52:39.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"body-parser vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nbody-parser <1.20.3 is vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled.

As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":8,"high":6,"critical":0},"dependencies":837,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":837}}
