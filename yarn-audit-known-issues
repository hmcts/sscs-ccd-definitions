For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`. \n\nVersion 0.1.10 adds backtracking protection when a custom regular expression is not provided, so it's still possible to manually create a ReDoS vulnerability if you are providing custom regular expressions.\n\nVersion 8.0.0 removes all features that can cause a ReDoS and stops exposing the regular expression directly.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j"},"1099517":{"findings":[{"version":"1.20.2","paths":["express>body-parser"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<1.20.3","module_name":"body-parser","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7","cves":["CVE-2024-45590"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=1.20.3","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2024-09-10T15:52:40.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.20.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-405"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1099517,"references":"- https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7\n- https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/commit/b2695c4450f06ba3b0ccf48d872a229bb41c9bce\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7","created":"2024-09-10T15:52:39.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"body-parser vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nbody-parser <1.20.3 is vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled.
