/**
 * Re-configures Serenity/JS with a new {@apilink Cast} of {@apilink Actor|actors}
 * you want to use in any subsequent calls to {@apilink actorCalled}.
 *
 * This function is an alias for {@apilink Serenity.engage},
 * which provides an alternative to calling {@apilink Actor.whoCan} directly in your tests
 * and is typically invoked in a "before all" or "before each" hook of your test runner of choice.
 *
 * :::tip configure vs engage
 * Calling {@apilink engage} replaces the currently configured {@apilink Cast|cast of actors},
 * but doesn't affect any other configuration.
 * If you want to reset the Serenity/JS configuration completely, use {@apilink configure} instead.
 * :::
 *
 * If your implementation of the {@apilink Cast} interface is stateless,
 * you can invoke this function just once before your entire test suite is executed, see
 * - [`beforeAll`](https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.6/global.html#beforeAll) in Jasmine,
 * - [`before`](https://mochajs.org/#hooks) in Mocha,
 * - [`BeforeAll`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/docs/support_files/hooks.md#beforeall--afterall) in Cucumber.js
 *
 * However, if your {@apilink Cast} holds state that you want to reset before each scenario,
 * it's better to invoke `engage` before each test using:
 * - [`beforeEach`](https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.6/global.html#beforeEach) in Jasmine
 * - [`beforeEach`](https://mochajs.org/#hooks) in Mocha,
 * - [`Before`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/docs/support_files/hooks.md#hooks) in Cucumber.js
 *
 * ## Engaging a cast of actors
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Actor, Cast } from '@serenity-js/core';
 *
 * class Actors implements Cast {
 *   prepare(actor: Actor) {
 *     return actor.whoCan(
 *       // ... abilities you'd like the Actor to have
 *     );
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * engage(new Actors());
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using with Mocha test runner
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { beforeEach } from 'mocha'
 *
 * beforeEach(() => engage(new Actors()))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using with Jasmine test runner
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import 'jasmine'
 *
 * describe('My feature', () => {
 *   beforeEach(() => engage(new Actors()))
 *
 *
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using with Cucumber.js test runner
 *
 * Engage `Actors` [before](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/support_files/hooks.md)
 * each test scenario:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Before } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
 *
 * Before(() => engage(new Actors()))
 * ```
 *
 * Engage `Actors` before scenarios with [specific tags](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/support_files/hooks.md#tagged-hooks):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Before } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
 *
 * Before('@web', () => engage(new Actors()))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using with Playwright Test runner
 *
 * [Serenity/JS Playwright Test module](/api/playwright-test) will configure the cast on your behalf,
 * so you don't need to call {@apilink engage}.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { describe, it, test } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
 *
 * describe('My feature', () => {
 *
 *   this.use({
 *     actors: new Actors()
 *   })
 *
 *   // test scenarios
 *
 * })
 * ```
